			<p> I am a Biomedical engineer studying the cause and effects of seizures in epileptic patients. At my job I'm responsible
				for localization of seizure onset and 3D reconstruction of images for patient surgery.</p>
			<p>I'm also involved in a large multi-site research study on Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).
				<br> SUDEP is a fatal complication of epilepsy. It is defined as the sudden and unexpected, non-traumatic and non-drowning
				death of a person with epilepsy, without a toxicological or anatomical cause of death detected during the post-mortem
				examination. The work I do will help pave the way on finding a cure for epilepsy and to identify biomarkers for at risk
				patients.</p>
			<p>The bootcamp course at Case Western Reserve University has taught me the tools necessary to build a surgical navigation
				application/database that will greatly help surgeons and hospital adminstation to track and monitor patient progress
				overtime.</p>
